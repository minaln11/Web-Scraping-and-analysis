# Web-Scraping-and-analysis

The objective is to understand webscraping using rvest library in R.  We scrape the relevant tables, extract mountain names, heights and links to individual mountain pages. After obtaining geographic coordinates for each mountain we plot them on world map colour-coded by height.
